# Simple React TODO app

This simple TODO app allows you to quickly create basic tasks and edit or mark them as completed. The interface was taken from [here](https://bbbootstrap.com/snippets/todo-task-list-badges-71324362#) and the css components were replaced by ReactBootstrap.

## Installation

Run the command below to install all the projects dependencies:

```bash
$ yarn
```

## Available Scripts

### `yarn start`

Runs the app along with the local server in the development mode.<br />
